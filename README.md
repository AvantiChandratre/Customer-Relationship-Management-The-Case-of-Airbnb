Project Overview
As an Airbnb account manager, we analyze historical data to predict host attrition and optimize a retention strategy. Using machine learning models, we identify high-risk properties and determine an optimal allocation of retention incentives to maximize Airbnb’s net profit.

Key Components
Data Analysis: Exploration of Airbnb property data to understand trends and attrition patterns.

Predictive Modeling: Machine learning models trained on past attrition data to estimate the likelihood of a property leaving the platform.

Retention Strategy: Selection of properties to receive a $1000 retention incentive based on expected revenue impact.

Evaluation: Net profit calculation based on Airbnb’s revenue model and grading rubric.

Report & Presentation: Documentation of methodology, results, and a class presentation on Dec 5, 2024.

Datasets
abb.csv: Historical Airbnb property data with attrition outcomes.

abb_new.csv: Current-year Airbnb property data used for retention strategy design.

Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)

Jupyter Notebook

Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
